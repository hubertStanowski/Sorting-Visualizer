# About the project

This application is a visualizing tool for sorting algorithms built using Python3 with pygame.

# Guide

### Required setup

- Make sure you have installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pygame](https://youtu.be/Y4Jn0UCqY28?t=163).
- For full experience make sure your screen resolution is above 1500x950 as this is the resolution of my app.
- Download the "main_script.py" file, navigate to its directory and run with "python main_script.py" (Windows & Linux) or "python3 main_script.py" (MacOS).

### Basic usage

- To select a sorting algorithm click on it; selected button will change its color.
- To run the algorithm click "RUN" (green button).
- To exit the program simply click "X" in the top right corner. **! If you do it while running an algorithm, session's settings will not be saved !**

### Additional info

- You can shuffle the array by pressing  "SHUFFLE" (yellow)
- You can change the size of the array by clicking: "S" (small), "M" (medium) and "L" (large) buttons; selected button will change its color.
- You can change the animation speed by clicking: "S" (slow), "N" (normal) and "F" (fast) buttons; selected button will change its color.
- Current settings will be saved to "settings.txt" file.
- If program takes too much or too litte of your screen, change the scale or resolution (Display settings).
